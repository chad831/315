Procedures for floating point #s
2's comp numbers
negatives, fractional, neg fractional

multicycle datapath diagrams, control signals

at, sp, gp, other regs

big endian left to right
little endian right to left ( used in our labs

branch and immediates, only uses shift left two comp on diagram

    practice: hex to binary
             and assembly to binary ( and vise versa )
        
        stack implementation, activation record, push, pop etc
        callee -> saves s regs and a regs
        caller -> t regs
        
        2s comp ( no hidden one ) vs sign magnitude
        example:
        0001 -> 1 / 8
        1110
        +001
        =1111 -> -1/8
        
        look at a mips program and determine output
        
        RISC process vs others      single cycle vs multicycle
            Von Nuemann        vs   Harvard Architechure
